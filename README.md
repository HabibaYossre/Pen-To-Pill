## **Overview**

**Pen to Pill (P2P)** is an AI-powered system that digitizes handwritten medical prescriptions, with a focus on complex multilingual documents written in Arabic and English. It aims to improve patient safety and healthcare efficiency by extracting structured medication data from unstructured, handwritten prescriptions.

## **Tools & Technologies**

- **Roboflow** ‚Äì Annotation tool for labeling Arabic and English words.
- **YOLOv8** ‚Äì Detects handwritten regions in prescriptions.
- **TrOCR** ‚Äì Transformer-based OCR for recognizing multilingual handwriting.
- **BART (mBART)** ‚Äì Corrects and structures extracted text into a standard format.
- **Python**, **PyTorch** ‚Äì Core implementation frameworks.
- **Google Colab / Kaggle Notebooks** ‚Äì Training & experimentation environments.

## üîç **Methodology**

The solution follows a multi-step pipeline:

1. **Handwritten Word Region Detection**
   - Custom annotations using Roboflow.
   - YOLOv8 model trained to detect word-level bounding boxes (Arabic & English).

2. **Duplicate Box Removal**
   - Non-Maximum Suppression (IoU = 0.8) to eliminate redundant detections.

3. **Box Sorting**
   - Sort boxes top-to-bottom, left-to-right for proper text sequence.

4. **Text Recognition (TrOCR)**
   - Preprocessed and resized word images.
   - Fine-tuned TrOCR model for accurate handwriting recognition.

5. **Text Reconstruction**
   - Combine individual words into a single prescription string.

6. **Text Correction & Structuring (BART)**
   - Clean and format OCR output into: `medicine dosage, medicine dosage, ...`

7. **Post-Processing**
   - Extract `(medicine, dosage)` pairs for digital use.

##  **Future Work**

- Expand the dataset with more real-world handwritten prescriptions.
- Improve mBART output consistency on edge cases.
- Integrate with digital health record systems and mobile applications.
- Extend multilingual support beyond Arabic-English.
